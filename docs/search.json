There will be a little bit of history, example of topics and datasets, an overview of the methods, and some reflections on the challenges faced by researchers, including in relation to Ethics and Privacy.\n\nVideo lecture: Watch the video below about Computational Social Science\n\n\nfrom IPython.display import YouTubeVideo\nYouTubeVideo(\"3dA1GYdSg-A\",width=600, height=337.5)\n\n\n        \n        \n\n\nIn this course, we are going to read some parts of the amazing book by Matthew Salganik “Bit By Bit: Social Research in the Digital Age”. Salganik is a professor in Sociology at Princeton, and an active researcher in Computational Social Science. You can read the book online, but I encourage you to buy it.\n\nReading: Bit by Bit, chapter 1 Start by reading the Introduction of the book, where you will get you an understanding of the history of the field and the general framework.\nReading 2: Bit by Bit, chapter 6 Read the Ethics chapter of the book. Here, I don’t expect you to read all the details. However, I want to make sure you get an overall understanding of the ethical challenges and some of the approaches that are used in the field to deal with these complex issues. You can focus on sections 6.4 and 6.6.\n\n\nExercise 1: Design your own Computational Social Science project.\nYou now have a sense of how digital data can be used to study society. Work in pairs.\n\nStart from an interesting social science question. Come up with one question about human behavior or society that you find interesting. Examples:\n\nHow does misinformation spread online?\n\nHow does working from home reshape when and where people spend time?\nWhat makes certain neighborhoods feel safer than others?\n\nMake it “computational”. Briefly write:\n\nWhat kind of digital data could help study this? (e.g., social media data, news, reviews, …) Important: Your data source must be something you could realistically access as a student (e.g., public datasets, open APIs, or data you could collect yourself)\nWho/what are the units of analysis? (people, neighborhoods, communities, …)\nOne measurable variable you could extract from data to answer your question.\n\nEthics check.\n\nName one ethical risk and how you might reduce it. You can refer to the areas of difficulties described in chapter 6.6 of Salganik’s book.\n\nSubmit. On DTU Learn, submit your best idea through the Survey “Design your own Computational Social Science project.”:\n\nResearch question\n\nData source\n\nUnit of analysis\nOne measurable variable\n\nOne ethical concern.\n\n\nIMPORTANT: Reach out during class/on Teams if you have doubts about the feasibility of your idea, or whether your research question makes sense.\n\n\n\nFor this exercise, I strongly recommend that you first develop your research question and basic idea without using an LLM. Once you feel you have a solid research idea and a dataset, you can use an LLM to refine and improve your solution. Why not start with an LLM? Because:\n\n\n\nAt the time of writing this exercise, even when prompted carefully, state-of-the-art LLMs (I tested ChatGPT 5.2) can suggest ideas that sound impressive but are not feasible\n\n\nBy spending time srtuggling with problems yourself, you build deeper understanding (which means you get also better at spotting weaknesses/feasibility issues)",

(e.g., API, open dataset, scraping).\n\nWhat is one limitation or bias of this data?\n\nGo to DTU Learn and fill the Survey “Data for Computational Social Science”.\n\nRemember that in this exercise, there is not a single correct answer. There could be multiple ways to gather data, and different data sources could shed lights on different aspects of scientists’ works and interactions.\n\n\n\nAs in the previous exercise, I recommend starting with your own idea.

    "text": "Part 3: Using web-scraping to gather data.\nAll right, so now it’s really time to start working on something a bit hands-on. The first thing we need to do is indeed to get DATA. As I said a few times by now, in this class we will do things from scratch. One of the ways to gather data from the web is to use web-scraping, which basically means getting information directly from web-pages. In the video below, I will give a brief overview on how to web-scrape web pages.\n\nVideo lecture: Watch the video below about web scraping (you can find here the notebook that I use in the video)\n\n\nfrom IPython.display import YouTubeVideo\nYouTubeVideo(\"nK_d0UQp4cE\",width=600, height=337.5)\n\n\n        \n        \n\n\n\nExercise 3 : Web-scraping the list of participants to the International Conference in Computational Social Science\nIt’s time to put things into practice. Remember that our goal will be to gather a dataset describing Computational Social Scientists and their work. As we have discussed, the field of Computational Social Science is loosely defined. To gather data, we will start from the list of researchers that have joined the most important scientific conference in Computational Social Science in 2025. The conference is called International Conference in Computational Social Science (IC2S2 in short). The assumption here is that the scientists who contribute to this conference are at the core of the field of Computational Social Science.\nYou can find the program of the 2025 edition of the conference at this link, and the list of organizers at this link. The conference program included many different contributions: keynote presentations, parallel talks, tutorials, posters.\n\nInspect the HTML of the two pages and use web-scraping to get the names of all researchers that contributed to the conference in 2025. The goal is the following:\n\nget as many names as possible including: organizers, keynote speakers, chairs, authors of parallel talks and authors of posters;\n\nensure that the collected names are complete and accuarate as reported in the website (e.g. both first name and family name);\n\nensure that no name is repeated multiple times with slightly different spelling.\n\nSome ideas you can apply for success:\n\nInspect the page through your web browser to identify the elements of the page that you want to collect. Ensure you understand the hierarchical structure of the page, and where the elements you are interested in are located within this structure.\nUse the BeautifulSoup Python package to navigate through the hierarchy and extract the elements you need from the page.\nYou can use the find_all method to find elements that match specific filters. Check the documentation of the library for detailed explanations on how to set filters.\nParse the strings to ensure that you retrieve “clean” author names (e.g. remove commas, or other unwanted charachters).\nIn some cases, the webpage only displays data that is actually loaded from an external file (for example a CSV or JSON file). If you notice this by inspecting the page, you may be able to download that file directly instead of scraping the HTML. This is much easier, cleaner, and less error-prone than parsing the rendered page.\n\nCreate the set of unique researchers that joined the conference and store it into a file.\n\nImportant: If you notice any issue with the list of names you have collected (e.g. duplicate/incorrect names), come up with a strategy to clean your list as much as possible.\n\nGo to DTU Learn and fill the Survey “Web Scraping”.\nHow many unique researchers do you get?\nExplain the process you followed to web-scrape the pages. Which choices did you make to accurately retreive as many names as possible? Which strategies did you use to assess the quality of your final list? Explain your reasoning and your choices.\n\n\n\n\nLLMs will likely not be able to solve this exercise correctly on their own (I tested GPT-5.2). The key is to break the problem into smaller subproblems by inspecting the HTML of the pages and identifying exactly which elements you need to extract. If you feel lazy, you can use an LLM to help write small, targeted functions for specific extraction steps. But make sure you carefully check the code and the output of each step. Iterate on your solution until the results are correct and complete.",

    "text": "Part 3: Tools we use in this class\n\n1) Github for collaborative development\nIn this course, we will use Github to develop code collaboratively.\nHow to use Github for developing your Project Assignment It is required that you and your group use Github to work on your assignemnts. In all group assignments, you will be asked to submit a link to a Git repository in which the commit history of the individual members of the group can be assessed. This is for me to check how the group has collaboratively developed code for the assignment (see more in the course Wiki).\nIf you are not familiar with Git/Github, I suggest going through these two tutorials:\n\nIntro Git Tutorial\nIntermediate Git Tutorial\n\n\n\n2) Teams for communication\nIn this course, we will use Teams to communicate. You can join the Teams Channel directly from DTU Learn.\nHow to use Teams:\n\nAsking questions publicly: If you have a question that may be useful to others, please post it on a public channel, so that everyone can see the reply.\nAsking questions privately: If you have a question that is irrelevant to others, you can send a private message to me.\nDiscuss among you: Feel free of course use Teams to discuss with your team members, or the rest of the class.\n\nIMPORTANT: You can expect to receive an answer from me within a few days.\n\n\n3) Python and Jupyter notebooks\nThe exercise you will solve during the class require using Python and Jupyter Notebooks. I suggest to use the Anaconda distribution with Python 3.10 or newer. Note that if you want to use another setup, that’s fine.\nIf you are not familiary with Jupyter notebooks, you can follow these instructions:\n\nDownload the Anaconda distribution of Python here.\nCreate an Anaconda environment for this class: conda create -n comsocsci2026\nActivate the environment “conda activate comsocsci2026”.\nInstall jupyter “conda install jupyter”.\nStart up the notebook by typing “jupyter notebook” and your terminal, and everything should be ready to use in your favorite browser.\n\nSuper important Everything we do going forward in this class will depend on you being comfortable with Python. There is simply no way that you will be able to do well, if you’re also struggling with Python on top of everything else you’ll be learning.\nSo if you’re not 100% comfortable with Python, I recommend you follow a tutorial to teach you Python, for example this one, before proceeding.\n\n\n4) Large Language Models\n\n\nWe all use LLMs for learning and coding. In this course, I’ll try to give you practical tips on how to use LLMs in a way that can actually help you learn.\n\n\nThroughout the class, you will see exercises that end with a purple note containing suggestions on how you might experiment with LLMs while working on that problem.\n\n\nUsing LLMs in teaching is still evolving, and I’m actively exploring ways we can use them to support your learning in this course. Let me start by addressing some of the questions you might naturally have.\n\n\nDo we need to code ourselves when AI can already write code?\n\n\nYes, because coding is not just writing syntax, but rather designing solutions to problems.\n\n\nThat often means:\n\n\n\nTaking a big problem\n\n\nBreaking it into smaller parts\n\n\nBreaking those parts down again\n\n\nSolving each piece\n\n\nPutting everything back together into a working solution\n\n\n\nAlong the way, you make many decisions. And taking good decisions require deep understanding of the problem and the methods. That is understanding that one can only get from experience.\n\n\nMy goal in this course is to help you build that experience, so you become a better problem solver, not just someone who can run code.\n\n\nBut can LLMs just do all the above for me?\n\n\nSometimes, but it depends on the problem.\n\n\nFor small, well-defined tasks, LLMs are often excellent. If the task is “sort this array,” they’ll almost certainly give you a correct solution.\n\n\nBut as problems get more complex and open-ended, LLMs become less reliable on their own. They can struggle with:\n\n\n\nDeciding how to structure the problem\n\n\nChoosing the right steps\n\n\nChecking whether the full solution actually makes sense\n\n\n\nAnd this is why, as of today, we still need a smart human in the loop. \n\n\nLet’s take one of our class projects: building a collaboration network of computational social scientists from publication data. This is a complex, multi-step problem. It requires making many design choices and solving several subproblems in the right order.\n\n\nThis is why when I tried to give this problem directly to state-of-the-art LLMs, the solutions I got have many flaws.\n\n\nSo… can I use LLMs to solve exercises?\n\n\nYou shall make sure you use them in a smart and thoughtful way\n\n\nFor the best learning and deepest understanding, the most effective approach is to first try solving the exercise on your own. Struggling a bit, making mistakes, and figuring things out yourself is a crucial part of learning. Once you have your own solution you can use an LLM to review it, improve it, or suggest alternative approaches.\n\n\nThat said, I know that sometimes you may be short on time or feel stuck. If you do rely more heavily on an LLM, keep in mind that many exercises are complex enough that if you paste the entire problem into an LLM, the answer will likely be incomplete or incorrect.\n\n\nFor many coding tasks, a better way to use LLMs is to:\n\n\n\nFirst break the problem into smaller steps yourself\n\n\nThen use an LLM to help with specific “simple enough” subproblems\n\n\nCarefully check whether the final solution works and makes sense by understanding the code and verifying the output\n\n\nIterate and improve your solution\n\n\n\nIf you work this way, LLMs can be a powerful learning tool. If you don’t, they can easily become a shortcut that prevents you from developing the skills this course is designed to build, and introduce mistakes into your work.",

Each week, we will post a number of exercises. After a set of lectures, I will post an assignment. The assignment is a subset of the exercises. This means that, if you solve the exercises each week, the assignments will be easy.\n\nFormalia regarding Assignments 1 & 2\n\nCreate a repository on GitHub or GitLab, where we can assess the commit history of the individual members of the group. The repository should stay private until the assignment is due.\nCollaboratively work on the assignment as a group.\nThe repo should include a Jupyter notebook (named Assignment1.ipynb or Assignment2.ipynb) that includes the solution to all exercises in the assignment.\nImportant: The first cell of the notebook should include the link to your Github repository and a contribution statement.\nFor the delivery:\n\nmake your repository public (on the day of the assignment submission)\n\nupload the Jupyter notebook on DTU Learn\n\nmake sure that your code runs and renders all images, prints, etc. We recommend restarting the kernel under ‘Kernel’ and then clicking Cell –&gt; Run all before uploading.\n\ndouble check that your file renders correctly. Remember that you’ll be annoyed to get bad evaluations because no-one could see your plots.\n\nTo help me navigate the Notebook, it’s a good idea to repeat the question you’re answering.\nTry to control the length of your notebook. While grading, I look at how you prioritise material and express yourself clearly and succinctly.\nRead the text carefully - make sure you understand the question. And make sure that you answer all sub-questions, etc. (It’s easy to miss something, so be thorough).\nDo not solve all exercises in a single code cell. Split your code according to the questions\nThe notebook is designed to contain your code, so do include it. But do keep it short & neat (minimize long outputs, etc)\nFormat your plots properly. Axes must be labeled, make sure there’s text explaining the figure, etc.\nMake sure that you use references when they’re needed and follow academic standards.\nBe precise, write in objective language (avoid: “I think …”, “In my opinion…”, etc) - if you make an observation, support it with data.\n\n\n\n\nProject Assignment\nThe point of the Project Assignments is to try out the skills you’ve learned in the course on your own dataset. We’ve been working on understanding networks and natural language processing, so the idea is to find a dataset to analyze that will let you show off what you can do.\n\nStandford Large Networks Dataset Collection is a collection of large network datasets.\nWikipedia API You can collect Wikipedia data for whatever you are into.\nYou can also use data from specialized wikis (examples include Wookiepedia, Game of Thrones Wiki, Simpson’s Wiki, etc)\nNetzschleuder. Another collection of Network Datasets.\nSocial Networks Awesome datasets. Another collection of public social network datasets.\n\nAnd new ideas for datasets are very welcome. You should work with something that interests you - that way the project will be much more fun to work on. You will be working together in groups just as for the first two assignments.\n\nProject Assignment A\nThe first part of the final project is a 5 minute presentation, which should explain the central idea/concept that you will investigate in your final project. You’re making the presentation so that I can give you feedback, and you can get ideas from other groups. The presentation must contain the following:\n\nAn explanation of the central idea behind your project (what is the idea?, why is it interesting? which datasets did you need to explore the idea?, how did you download them)\nAn outline on the elements you’ll need to get to your goal & the implementation plan.\nA walk-through of your preliminary data-analysis, addressing\n\nWhat is the total size of your data? (MB, number of rows, number of variables, etc)\nWhat is the network you will be analyzing? (number of nodes? number of links?, degree distributions, what are node attributes?, etc.)\nWhat is the text you will be analyzing?\nHow will you tie the two together?\n\n\nBut other than that, there are no constraints on the format. Note that you will present to the entire class.\nHanding in the assignment: Simply upload your slides on DTU Learn. Note that since Project Assignment A now requires significant data-work, you have 2 weeks to create the video presentation.\n\n\nProject Assignment B\nThe deliverables for the Final project will be\nA website. The website should contain your analysis, it should tell the story about the data that you’re interested in getting across. The website should not be technical, but rather aim at using visualization and explanation to get your insights across to a non-scientific reader.\nAn explainer Notebook. The Notebook should contain all the behind the scenes stuff, details on the dataset, why you’ve selected this particular dataset, explanations of your choices regarding network analysis, etc. You should link to the notebook from the site. The idea is that you can create much more complex, fun and interactive analysis (and visualizations) on line. So the website is a way for you to present your work in a way that everyone can understand it … including dynamic visualizations, interactive analysis, etc, etc … that would not work on a piece of paper.\n\n\nMore about the website\nThis part of the assignment is quite free. The main point of the website is to present your idea/analyses to the world in a way that showcases your use of what you’ve learned in class. It can be as simple as an old fashioned static web-page, and as complicated as you want it to be. Let your creativity run wild (but keep in mind that this is not a coding class - we care mostly about content and analysis).\nThe website should be self-contained and tell the story of your dataset without the need for the Explainer Notebook (the purpose of the notebook is to provide additional details for interested readers). Here are some requirements\n\nThe page should say clearly what the dataset is and give the reader some idea of its most important properties (kind of Project Assignment A-style).\nThe page should contain your network and text analysis (that’s the main part).\nThere should be download options for data sets (so the user can play around).\nYou must link to the Explainer Notebook (more details below) that explains the details of your analysis (including all of the machine learning, the model selection, etc). You can achieve this with a link to a notebook displaying on the nbviewer.\nFor hosting, I recommend using your DTU website or Github pages.\n\n\n\nMore on the explainer notebook\nThe notebook should contain your analysis and code. Please structure it into the following 4 sections\n\nMotivation\n\nWhat is your dataset?\nWhy did you choose this/these particular dataset(s)?\nWhat was your goal for the end user’s experience?\n\nBasic stats. Let’s understand the dataset better\n\nWrite about your choices in data cleaning and preprocessing\nWrite a short section that discusses the dataset stats (here you can recycle the work you did for Project Assignment A)\n\nTools, theory and analysis. Describe the process of theory to insight\n\nTalk about how you’ve worked with text, including regular expressions, unicode, etc.\nDescribe which network science tools and data analysis strategies you’ve used, how those network science measures work, and why the tools you’ve chosen are right for the problem you’re solving.\nHow did you use the tools to understand your dataset?\n\nDiscussion. Think critically about your creation\n\nWhat went well?\nWhat is still missing? What could be improved? Why?",

Explainer notebook\nYour notebook should make it easy to understand what you did and why. - Is data collection and preprocessing clearly documented? - Are the methods explained in a way others can follow? - Is there real interpretation and reflection, not just outputs? - Is the notebook well structured and readable?\n\n\n3. Use of Network Science\nWe evaluate how well you use network science tools - Are the chosen techniques appropriate for the question? - Are they applied correctly? - Is the analysis thorough, rather than just a few basic measures?\n\n\n4. Use of text analysis methods\nSame idea for the text analysis. - Are the methods suitable for the problem? - Are they implemented correctly? - Is the analysis deep enough to support your conclusions?\n\n\n5. Website\nYour project should be understandable to someone outside the course. - Are the visualizations informative and well chosen? - Are explanations clear and accessible to a broad audience? - Is the website easy to navigate and pleasant to use?\n\n\n6. What makes a project excellent:\nThese additional aspects can lift a project from solid to outstanding: - Creativity and original thinking\n- Taking on a challenging or ambitious question/dataset - Showing awareness of ethical issues (data use, bias, privacy, limitations)",

The notebook explains pretty much everything - the rest will be explained during the lectures. In case the link doesn’t work, you can also see the file here on Github, but the videos won’t display properly\nWeek 1: Intro to Computational Social Science. This week is all about getting started: learning about how the course works, make sure you master the tools you need to follow the class. I will give you an introduction to the field of Computational Social Science. And, we will start with something hands-on: you will learn about web-scraping and start gathering some data from the web.\n\nReading: Bit by Bit, chapter 1 Start by reading the Introduction of the book, where you will get you an understanding of the history of the field and the general framework.\nReading: Bit by Bit, chapter 6 Read the Ethics chapter of the book. Here, I don’t expect you to read all the details. However, I want to make sure you get an overall understanding of the ethical challenges and some of the approaches that are used in the field to deal with these complex issues. You can focus on sections 6.4 and 6.6."
